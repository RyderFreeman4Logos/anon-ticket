1a571bf6 chore(repo): add workspace gitignore
Established a baseline `.gitignore` that covers Cargo builds, wasm-pack artifacts, IDE clutter, and local configuration in order to keep future Rust worktree clean despite the current minimal file set. Documented why several project-specific paths (matrix bot configs, proto outputs, drafts) remain untracked so contributors know where to place sensitive data without risking accidental commits. Highlighted the intent to pair every public English log with a private Chinese mirror while keeping the mirror ignored so bi-lingual context is preserved locally without polluting history; future entries should follow the same diary style.
